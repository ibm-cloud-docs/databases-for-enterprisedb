If you encounter errors when connecting to your {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-enterprisedb_full}} deployment, review these common causes and resolutions.
{: shortdesc}

You receive an error message or fail to connect to a {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-enterprisedb}} deployment.  If reviewing application logs, you might see errors that mention intermittent connection timeouts or unable to connect.
{: tsSymptoms}

Review the following information to troubleshoot and resolve common connectivity problems:
{: #tsResolve}

* An unsecured connection is a common cause of connectivity errors.  All {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-enterprisedb}} connections use TLS/SSL encryption; {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-enterprisedb}} rejects unsecured connections.  To avoid errors, make sure you configured a secure connection.  Refer to [Getting Started](/docs/databases-for-enterprisedb?topic=databases-for-enterprisedb-getting-started) for an example of a secure connection.
* If you are using a private endpoint, make sure that you specify connection strings that contain the private endpoint (see [Credentials for Private Endpoints](/docs/databases-for-enterprisedb?topic=cloud-databases-service-endpoints#credentials-for-private-endpoints)) and that you followed the steps in [Connecting through Private Endpoints](/docs/databases-for-enterprisedb?topic=cloud-databases-service-endpoints#private-endpoint-connections).
* If your application log captures a short connection interruption, that behavior is expected as a normal part of operations for this managed service. You want to design your applications to retry connections when errors are caused by a temporary loss in connectivity to your deployment or to IBM Cloud. However, if you experience several minutes of connection interruption check the Cloud Status for the service.
