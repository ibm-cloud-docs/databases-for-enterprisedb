# Managing Users, Roles, and Privileges 
{: #user-management}

{{site.data.keyword.databases-for-enterprisedb_full}} uses a system of roles to manage database permissions. Roles are used to give a single user or a group of users a set of privileges. You can determine roles, groups, and privileges for all roles across your deployment by using the `psql` command `\du`.

When you provision a new deployment in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, you are automatically given an admin user to access and manage {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-enterprisedb}}.

## The `admin` user

When you provision a new deployment in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, you are automatically given an admin user to access and manage {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-enterprisedb}}. Once you [set the admin password](/docs/databases-for-enterprisedb?topic=databases-for-enterprisedb-admin-password), you can use it to connect to your {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-enterprisedb}} deployment.

When admin creates a resource in a database, like a table, admin owns that object. Resources that are created by admin are not accessible by other users, unless you expressly grant permissions to them.

The biggest difference between the admin user and any other users you add to your deployment is the [`pg_monitor`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/default-roles.html) and [`pg_signal_backend`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/default-roles.html) roles. The `pg_monitor` role provides a set of permissions that makes the admin user appropriate for monitoring the database server. The `pg_signal_backend` role provides the admin user the ability to send signals to cancel queries and connections that are initiated by other users. It does not provide the ability to send signals to processes owned by superusers.

You can also use the admin user to grant these two roles to other users on your deployment.

If you want to expose the ability to cancel queries to other database users, you can grant the `pg_signal_backend` role from the admin user. For example, 
```sql
GRANT pg_signal_backend TO joe;
``` 
to allow the user `joe` to cancel backends. You can also grant `pg_signal_backend` to all the users with the `ibm-cloud-base-user` role with 
```sql
GRANT pg_signal_backend TO "ibm-cloud-base-user";
``` 
Be aware this privilege allows the user or users to terminate any connections to the database, so assign it with care.

Similarly, if you want to set up a specific monitoring user, `mary`, you can use
```
GRANT pg_monitor TO mary;
```
You can also grant `pg_signal_backend` to all the users with the `ibm-cloud-base-user` role with 
```sql
GRANT pg_monitor TO "ibm-cloud-base-user";
```

## _Service Credential_ Users

Users that you [create through the _Service Credentials_ pane](/docs/databases-for-enterprisedb?topic=databases-for-enterprisedb-connection-strings#creating-users-in-_service-credentials_) are members of `ibm-cloud-base-user`. They are able to log in, create users, and create databases.

When a user in a group creates a resource in a database, like a table, all users that are in the same group have access to that resource. Resources that are created by any of the users in `ibm-cloud-base-user` are accessible to other users in `ibm-cloud-base-user`, including the admin user.

## Users who are created through the CLI and the API

Users that you create through the Cloud Databases API and the Cloud Databases CLI will also be members of `ibm-cloud-base-user`. They are able to log in, create users, and create databases.

When a user creates a resource in a database, like a table, all users that are in the same group have access to that resource. Resources that are created by any of the users in `ibm-cloud-base-user` are accessible to other users in `ibm-cloud-base-user`, including the admin user.

Users that are created directly from the API and CLI do not appear in _Service Credentials_, but you can [add them](/docs/databases-for-enterprisedb?topic=databases-for-enterprisedb-connection-strings#adding-users-to-_service-credentials_) if you choose.

## The read-only user

The `ibm-cloud-base-user-ro` manages privileges for users that are created to access read-only replicas. More information can be found on the [Configuring Read-only Replicas](/docs/databases-for-enterprisedb?topic=databases-for-enterprisedb-read-only-replicas) page.

## Other `ibm` Users

If you run the `\du` command with your admin account, you might notice users that are named `ibm`,  `ibm-cloud-base-user`, and `ibm-replication`.

The `ibm-cloud-base-user` is used as a template to manage group roles for other users. It is used to manage the users who are created through the CLI and API as well as enable the integration with the _Service Credentials_ user creation on IBM Cloud. A user that is a member of `ibm-cloud-base-user` inherits the create role and create database attributes from `ibm-cloud-base-user`. The `ibm-cloud-base-user` is not able to log in.

The `ibm` and the `ibm-replication` accounts are the only superusers on your deployment. A superuser account is not available for you to use. These users are internal administrative accounts that manage replication, metrics, and other functions that ensure the stability of your deployment.

## Users created with `psql`

You can bypass creating users through IBM Cloud entirely, and create users directly in {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-enterprisedb}} with `psql`. This allows you to make use of PostgreSQL's native [role and user management](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/database-roles.html). Users and roles created in `psql` must have all of their privileges set manually, including privileges to the objects that they create.

Users that are created directly in {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-enterprisedb}} do not appear in _Service Credentials_, but you can [add them](/docs/databases-for-enterprisedb?topic=databases-for-enterprisedb-connection-strings#adding-users-to-_service-credentials_) if you choose. 

Note that these users are not integrated with IAM controls, even if added to _Service Credentials_.
