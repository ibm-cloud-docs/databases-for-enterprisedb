Review the following details about the {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-enterprisedb}} deprecation:

- A *deprecation* is a process, and we announced the beginning of that process. It begins with the *announcement* (this page), continues with *end of marketing,* 
and ends with *end of support.* Nothing happens until those announced dates above.

- At the *end of marketing,* users who don't have {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-enterprisedb}} running workloads will be blocked from deploying new applications. 
However, all users {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-enterprisedb}} instances deployed can keep using them and restore from backups if necessary.

- At the *end of support* stage, all {{site.data.keyword.databases-for-enterprisedb}} deployments will be disabled and deleted.
